                As a Fish Camp counselor at Texas A&M, I had the opportunity to guide and mentor incoming freshmen, helping them transition smoothly into college life.
                My role was rooted in service, where I focused on creating a welcoming and inclusive environment that allowed new students to feel comfortable, ask questions, and learn about the traditions and values that define the Aggie Spirit. 
                I led small groups, facilitated activities, and organized discussions that fostered a strong sense of community, ensuring that each freshman felt seen, heard, and supported. These interactions were not just about sharing information but about building trust and a sense of belonging, 
                which are crucial in helping new students navigate their first year.
                Through service-oriented leadership, I aimed to make a positive impact on their college journey by equipping them with the confidence and resources they needed to succeed both academically and socially. 
                Whether it was through team-building exercises, one-on-one conversations, or simply being a reliable presence, my goal was to help freshmen overcome the challenges of adapting to a new environment. 
                My commitment to service extended beyond the camp itself; I continually strived to be a mentor and resource for them even after camp ended. 
                By staying connected and offering ongoing support, I was able to foster lasting relationships and provide guidance as they navigated their first year at Texas A&M.

                The experience taught me the profound impact that service and mentorship can have on individuals during pivotal moments in their lives. 
                It reinforced my belief in the power of community and the importance of giving back, which are values I will carry forward in my future endeavors. 
                Serving as a Fish Camp counselor was not only about leadership but about making a meaningful difference in the lives of others, an experience that has been both humbling and incredibly rewardingAs a Fish Camp counselor,
